# GoogleFindMyTools Home Assistant

This is a fork of https://github.com/leonboe1/GoogleFindMyTools

It includes a new script, publish_mqtt.py that will publish the location of all your devices to an MQTT broker. These devices are then discoverable by home assistant and you can display them on a map, make automations etc.

Just run this script on a cronjob every so often to keep things up to date.
